        <p>Why do you want to buy nice knives? A sharp knite decreases the likelyhood or cutting yourself. Nice knives encourage you to cook 
            more. Everyone has a knife set and they are the definition of BIFL If you take care or them.</p>
        <p>The Shun Premier kives are my recommendation because:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>High quality Japanese knife. Hand crafted, damascus Cladding (metal alloys layered and folded while hot before being
                shaped into a blade), VG-Max cutting steel (fancy talk for good steel), higher quality wooden handle </li>
            <li>Large collection. I can get another type of knife with the same aesthetics. Personally I don't like
                having knives with different handles </li>
            <li>Timeless and luxurious look</li>
        </ol>
        <p><i>Yes, I know there are better Japanese knives out there for less price.</i></p>
    </div>
    <div class="end" ><br>
        Other random things I learned along the way:
        <ol>
            <li>If you like western style, try Wustof. In my research, German knives on average tend to be less sharp but hold their sharpness 
                longer while Japanese Knives tend to be snader. Out as a result is more orittle and more likelv to chid and need resnardenine. 
                ladanese Knives aiso tend to de lignter while German knives have more of a heft to them</li>
            <li>You really only need four knives In the kitchen: pairing knife, chet knife or Santoku knife, a serrated bread knife, and a honing steel</li> 
            <li>Very difficult to sharpen a serrated bread knife, so this is not really BIFL</li>
        </ol>
